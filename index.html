   <h2>The latest HTML5 features</h2>

   <p class="right">
      Intro of audio and video:
      Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their
      website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity, reflections,
      gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to
      build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.

      Vector Graphics:
      This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be
      used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to
      create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading
      graphics much faster on the web. That's the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.

      There are so many latest features along with these in html.

   <p class="style_">
      Web fonts have become an integral part of web design as they allow designers to go beyond the limited set of default
      fonts available on users' devices. Choosing the right font can convey a website's personality, establish brand identity,
      and influence user perception. In addition, proper font selection contributes to readability and accessibility, ensuring
      that users can easily consume and understand the content.

         Chrome is one of the most popular browsers in the world and is known for its fast performance, strong security, and easy
         customization. Some of the key features of Chrome include its multi-tab interface, extensions, and built-in Google
         Translate. In addition to these features, Chrome also has a reputation for being a memory-intensive browser, which can
         cause issues on older or less powerful devices. Despite this, Chrome remains a popular choice for many users due to its
         strong performance and easy-to-use interface.
         Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google that uses the WebKit layout engine. It was released as a
         beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008. As of
         September 2012, according to StatCounter, Google Chrome had 34% worldwide usage share of web browsers making it the most
         widely used web browser. (wikipedia)
         
         An Internet browser developed by Google, that combines a minimal design with sophisticated technology to make the Web
         faster, safer and easier. The Google Chrome browser offers features including access to favourite pages instantly with
         thumbnails, desktop shortcuts to launch Web applications, and independently run tabs within the browser to prevent
         browser crashing.
         
         Chrome is known for is simplicity and speed, and people use it because it gets the job down, fast. But it doesnâ€™t end
         there, while being simple it is also very customizable allowing users to make it their own, some people get rather
         sceptical due to that, as they think, if its highly customizable, how can it be simple?
         
         Chromes UI is flawless; its simple yet effective that your mind just knows where to go without having to think. This
         is one of the main goals for any browser, to achieve this, the design and icons that the browser uses have to be
         recognisable straight away, for instance, the button to get back to chromes homepage is shaped as a house, this way our
         brain quickly realises it.Click here to check out the web browser now

      Skeuomorphism in web design is about creating elements that mimic their real-world counterparts in look, feel, and
      function, providing a familiar and intuitive user experience. It helps users quickly understand how to interact with
      various elements, making the interface more user-friendly.
      Parallax scrolling is a technique where background content moves at a different speed than foreground content, creating
      an illusion of depth and a more dynamic visual experience.
      Kinetic typography is when text is animated in order to capture attention and convey messages dynamically. This trend
      elevates the role of text from mere information conveyance to an engaging visual element.
      Typography is evolving in every way possible. Designers are experimenting with layout, size, and color, as well as
      incorporating dynamic and interactive elements.
      
      Instead of being just a way to communicate a message, typography now is a character on the screen and used as an active
      design element that enhances the overall aesthetic and appeal of a site.

      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination
      of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the
      text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for
      the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g.
      HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of
      making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this
      independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours,
      fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and
      designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
